## AI-Powered Price Comparison Tool with AI Studio + Cursor

This repository demonstrates how **Oxylabs AI Studio** and **Cursor** can be combined to build a **scalable, low-code price comparison tool**.  
The project simplifies e-commerce scraping workflows, making it accessible to engineers of all skill levels.  

Developers can use this open-source integration to extract product data at scale with **enterprise-grade reliability**.


## Use Case: Price Comparison Tool

**Scenario:**  
A business needs to compare competitor product prices efficiently across categories or regions.

**Solution:**  
- **Browser Agent** collects product URLs, handles pagination, and adapts to location-specific categories.  
- **AI-Scraper** extracts structured product data (titles, prices, availability).  
- **Cursor** simplifies coding tasks with AI-assisted suggestions for seamless integration.  

**Final Output:**  
Structured product data ready for analytics, reporting, or integration into pricing workflows.


## Key Features

- **Low-code simplicity** - Build custom scraping workflows without advanced coding knowledge.  
- **Enterprise-ready infrastructure** - Automated CAPTCHA solving, IP block handling, and dynamic browsing.  
- **Pre-built scraper** - Open-source `ecommerce-category-scraper` for rapid adoption.  
- **Flexible scalability** - Works for small projects (free AI Studio credits) or enterprise-scale scrapes.  
- **Cost optimization** - Cursor reduces coding effort; AI Studio ensures task-based scalability.  


## Workflow

1. **Browser Agent** - Collects all product URLs (with pagination & geo-specific categories).  
2. **AI-Scraper** - Extracts structured data fields (e.g., pricing, product name, stock).  
3. **Cursor** - Refines integration code with context-aware AI suggestions.  
4. **Result** - Clean, structured dataset ready for business intelligence tools.
